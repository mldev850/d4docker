- Node.js
-Express
- Docker (for containerization)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Build and Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed on your system.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t express-user-api .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 express-user-api
